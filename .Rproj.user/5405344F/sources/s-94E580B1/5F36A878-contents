  Apéro is a unique kind of casual get-together in French culture, when you gather with friends and get to know each other better over some apéritifs, snacks, and anything in between. A good apéro is one where you'd happily spend a few hours just hanging out.
  
  I hope this theme helps you create your own virtual apéro. A place where you and your site's visitors enjoy spending time, and one that helps folks get to know you better.

## Who am I ?

I am a researcher and an analyst, I have just graduated with a Master’s of Science from Tunis Business School, specializing in quantitative and statistical analysis of efficiency and productivity. Previously I have graduated from ISG Sousse with a Bachelor(3 years) degree in quantitative economics.

Since early ages I got into computers and programming, I am now applying my skills in statistical analysis and modeling using the lovely R language in my research. I also use Python and Julia occasionally. I am an advocate for open source software and scientific research, and especially a Linux user.

I believe that the most important skill I needed to learn and develop is writing, which is the purpose of this blog(among other things). This blog is a work in progress and most of the stuff written here need lots of tweaking and are the result of deep frustration back when I was trying to finish my master’s thesis or whenever I’m bored enough to play with random datasets as you can see in the projects section.
