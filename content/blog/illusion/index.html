<p><em>Almost everyone would say that they have high standards, in people they meet, probably in food, and sometimes in the way they do stuff. In this article I will be talking about why high standards are an illusive motto made for teens who need the entire attention of the world, and why at the end of the day, it only depends on how you perceive yourself rather than the others, and how reality will make you change your mind every time.</em></p>
<div id="why-am-i-writing-this." class="section level2">
<h2>Why am I writing this.?</h2>
<p>This is part of my trials to improve my writing skills, however, the specific subject wasn’t chosen for this reason, it was for another. As some of you know, I started working as a Market research analyst in a company in Tunis, a famous firm that has an interesting momentum, frankly I didn’t know what to expect, and basically was eager to just play with data, as I always do, in a very sophisticated environment using very sophisticated tools, <em>yes, a high standard in conducting analysis is okay</em>. Guess what.? <strong>REALITY SUCKS</strong>.</p>
<p>What you are expected to do primarily is basically exchange emails and phone calls, heck, I should build a bot for this. It makes no sense for your work to be entirely based on exchanging information with your superior, especially in this age of digitization. Get your work done, in the cloud, the rest should be taken care of by someone, who’s job is to do just that. doing two jobs at the same time, sucks, when you want to become a better programmer and data scientist, but I must say, boy how you learn from this reality, which gets us to our main point.</p>
<p>Dreaming big, and changing the world are two different things. When you dream to become a better programmer, without making the time slot to actually become so, is the high standard you want to achieve, but without putting the work it will just stay a thought on a fluffy cloud. Keeping it real on the other hand, in this case my crappy job, is what will make you stronger, make you learn stuff, prepare yourself for the coming events, things you never thought you would do, by just doing your job the right way: the best way possible. This is the comparison I want to propose in this article, your high standards will keep you from the real thing. the real high standard is to get your job done, and make a slot for what ever else you want to do. keeping the dream, without a plan, is as useless as the illusion that comes with it.</p>
<p>On another side though, the same thing appears to happen concerning this illusion of where you went to school. It is ridiculous, that some people think that they have a superior hand just because they graduate from a specific place, it doesn’t matter where you got your pretty diploma from, what matters is what can you do <em>in real life</em>, how aware are you of how much you are prepared to assume responsibility. The sad stories happen when people think they are mature enough, when they are not. Beside the chronic blindness that this illusion creates, it makes personal relationships really hard. And it gets to it’s peak, when the subject of this illusion is aware of that illusion, but he refuses to let it go, because they finally realize it’s all they got. So they keep pushing, until they breakdown, and screw up everything they stood for by their illusion.</p>
<p>I know that some time what I write doesn’t make much sense, but I am in the process of learning how to write my thoughts down, and it is an extremely difficult task. Especially when it is work related and a <em>Shush_Shush</em> policy should be maintained, even if I know that almost no none will ever read this.</p>
<p>I just wanted to clear up to first myself, and to whoever might be reading this accidentally, that: having big dreams and large desires to learn and do different stuff is not just okay, it’s necessary for one’s sanity. However, keeping those dreams as thoughts induced in the idea of standards, <em>without an actual plan</em> is just a waste of time, and a toxic behavior. What is needed though is strong will and discipline, <em>Reality is the only standard you have</em>, and in case you want that changed, you should take matters in hand, and <em>push your standards up through hard honest work around your dreams</em>, while of course keeping it real.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by.</p>
