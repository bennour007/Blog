<p>Just Imagine your everyday life without your phone, your Facebook home page, or your instagram feed. Imagine that you don’t have to respond to that annoyingly attractive notification sound. Imagine you can have a conversation with someone without them staring at a screen in the middle of talking.</p>
<p>For a some time I have been, as most of you, if not all, a <em>slave</em> to my phone. This year, I had to write my thesis, a job that is mentally demanding and exhausting, and for some time, I couldn’t focus enough to get anything done. And since I quit using my phone in an addictive way I can spend hours in raw focusing well, being extremely efficient and getting things done. The fact that you are not depending on that dopamine dose you get from that like on your posts or getting a friend invitation, or people talking to you and sharing your stuff, <em>is liberating</em>. The thing is, what you are doing is letting a company like Facebook use your potential, maybe in writing, music, creating content or even doing things by hand like leather-craft(&lt;3), in order to sell your data with billions of dollars. while of course sucking the life, the talent, and the energy out of you, and leaving you talentless and basically with no actual skill to face the world.</p>
<p>I am saying this because I am done with stupid people using technology the wrong way, and I am not talking about your average consumer, I am talking about Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and other stupid sapiens making the rest of the sapiens as smart as they are(not that much). The revolution they are making will only lead to a tyrant state where freedom has no meaning because these gurus own you, own your data, and can basically shape your thinking and your belief the way they please. That’s why I quit their platforms, where the free word have no meaning and basically doesn’t exist. As sapiens with unlimited mental capabilities we can do, and be more, much more than the dopamine junkies that silicon valley turned us into.</p>
<p>For this reason, I decided to take back control of my life, my dopamine levels, and my mental progress to become a more intelligent, capable, and productive sapien. I love to be free, and I will always thrive to be so. I also hope that this mindset motivate me to work on my writing skills, and become a better writer, <em>at the end, what’s a researcher but a nerd who writes well</em>.</p>
<p>Writing down ideas in a coherent and readable manner is a skill that any educated person should have, unfortunately, we haven’t been informed as students on how much it is important to write well. I take this as a challenge, where I will start writing one article a week. I will use tags to identify topics and make searching articles as friendly as possible.</p>
<p>All of these Ideas I have presented to you in this short article are based on</p>
<ul>
<li><p>freedom</p></li>
<li><p>minimalism</p></li>
<li><p>independence</p></li>
<li><p>evolution</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I will dedicate in the future detailed articles on each of these fundamental requirements for a sustainable life.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by.</p>
