<p>At the time of writing these words I was spending my last few hours in the REACH office in Tunis, closing almost 4 months of what I may call a very interesting, challenging and international experience. This is an appreciation post to this wonderful short experience I had in REACH and a continuation to what I described in the previous blog post.</p>
<p>After leaving National Pen, I had to start over, question everything, and simply reflect on everything I went through. The idea was to sell all the skills and experience I have, and use that to get a new job that might help me find meaning in my life(not that I don’t have any, but it kinda help to have a job you like to wake up to every morning.). My job hunting journey was difficult and the path there was very rocky.</p>
<p>One month in I had a local company offering me a job as a BI analyst,while at the same time having another unofficial offer as an R consultant with the WHO Afro. I decided to go with the latter until they emailed me that they changed their minds for some reason and won’t proceed with an official offer even after I integrated their official communication channels. Basically I turned down an official offer for a non official one, waited for the best, but the best never happened at that point. You can imagin the heavy toll of such a severe disapointement on me while in a fragile mental state already, TLDR; it wasn’t good.</p>
<p>Eventually I had to move on and continue in my objective: landing a job that brings meaning to my life, a job that challenges me technically and that I can harness experience from doing it everyday.</p>
<p>Till that point, I couldn’t really tell how far or close I’m to my objective, it was unclear to me how good or bad I was doing. I conduct countless interviews and technical tests but the response is usually the same, either <em>“None”</em>, or an email starting with <em>“we regret”</em>. The latter response was rarely transmitted to me though. Tunisian recruiters usually(except some rare examples as I said) never informed me of the fate of my application, I cannot fathom the idea that a professional recruiter would behave in such a rude and demeaning manner, it’s simply disgusting.</p>
