<p>The man in the high castle touched my arm and praised the body change that I went through, ‘would you care to grab a bite when you are in Tunis?’, he asked in a weirdly dominant and polite manner. ‘Yeah with pleasure, I’ll call you’. Little did I know that this quick exchange would be a focal point regarding my future career decisions.</p>
<p>I called the man in the high castle a few days later and we agreed on a date and time, we met in the conference room of the 8th floor of his company’s building, where I waited for him for about 20 minutes, he is a busy man after all. ‘Finally, he is here’, I said to myself after I heard his footsteps approaching the room’s entrance. ‘Hi Mohamed, how are you?’ he asked with a charming smile, we sat, and he immediately asked ‘From all your peers’, and he knows few, ‘you seem the only one who is still working in Tunis, I would like to know why!’. Long story short, the man in the high castle popped the bubble I was living in. The bubble where I settled and embraced mediocrity.</p>
<p>This all started when I was studying in Sousse I was very disappointed by the school, the courses, the students, and the quality of the experience in general. I was expecting some fancy-ass place where people are working hard to improve themselves and bring value to society, but I found none of that. I was struggling to make discussions or communicate ideas with people around me. The subjects, discussions, the words used, and what was perceived as achievements in that place did not differ at all from what you expect to hear in a popular café or bar anywhere in Tunisia. It was a place where mediocrity and shallowness are the rules not the exception and that was an important factor in the decline of my mental health during that period.</p>
<p>I needed to move forward. ‘Tatakae, Hsin, Tatakae’.</p>
<p>Days went by, and I found myself doing a master’s in TBS, where I found what is now my close circle of friends. The difference in the quality of the experience compared to what I witnessed in Sousse was remarkably superior from day one. It was a good break from what I went through previously, and basically what it’s like in most other schools and institutions in Tunisia.</p>
<p>After graduation, I applied for countless opportunities yet weirdly I only had one offer from National Pen and I accepted it, there I met some of my closest friends, and learned how to deal with my anxiety and how to be a true team player. Still, I hated my job due to the misery and despair I felt for not fulfilling my true potentialan. And bit by bit I stopped my side hustles, community engagement, personal projects, and other habits. The fear of rejection, being judged, and the fact that I had a truely amazing circle in the company kept me from dealing with how I felt about it. Essentially I trapped myself again in a bubble because it was the easiest way to manage my disappointment and dissatisfaction, just like what happened in Sousse. And this was the realization that struck me somewhere in the middle of the man in the high castle’s monologue. I felt sick for a few days after that encounter and consumed ungodly amounts of alcohol to comfort myself, yet I couldn’t be at peace.</p>
<p>I had to move forward again, I had to liberate myself, and my real potential.</p>
<p>There came the day I decided to revolt against the bubble again, I resigned after a few weeks from that exchange, and finally liberated myself from a tyranny I created out of fear and despair.</p>
<p>Cheers.!</p>
