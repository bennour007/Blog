<p>Most of the times when we ask someone why don’t they workout, they will simply answer: because they have no time for that. Indeed, lack of time is the most popular excuse for basically anything. Yet, unlike gravity and laws of motions, there is no mathematical modeling of time. Which means, that most of our excuses are lies induced with a metaphysical illusion that gives legitimacy to the events in our lives and existence in general.</p>
<p>Time is not only a scarce resource of which each individual possess limited amount, its also multidimensional, i.e: there is always a better, more efficient activity that can be done instead of the one actually done. In fact, if we adopt this assumption, it renders most of our lives, if not all of it, inefficient, or rather, wasted. This is a terrifying idea.</p>
<p>In average we spend one third of our lives sleeping. Therefore, we can only optimize two thirds of our lives to be well invested time-wise. Hence, the problem here is not what part to optimize of your life, or why, or when? But rather, How?</p>
<p>Moreover, the subject of time is beyond the individual scope, but rather a universal one. In the movie Lucy, Scarlett Johansson, summarized the entire knowledge of the human race in one quote, by relating the legitimacy of any event to time. Indeed, “The only unit of measure is time”. In contrast however, we can’t really describe what time actually is.</p>
<p>Humanity have created some tools in a quest to model and measure time. These tools took various forms throughout history, most of which are inspired by natural or religious events. However, in an era characterized by increased speed, tremendous complexity and competition, as well as a free flow of huge amount of data, information and human-threatening artificial intelligence, are the current forms of time measurement tools still relevant? Can we really rely on them to model, allocate, and measure our time efficiently? Is there another form, or model, that can allow us to measure time in a more relevant and coherent manner?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, beside few trials from some scientists, and private companies here and there there is no serious debate that has been adopted in order to answer the questions above. We need, more than ever, to think this through on an international level and actually predict the outcome that such a change can bring to the world.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by.</p>
