Today I met with a dear friend of mine, we met up over some coffe. I showed him this blog, and he gave me valuable feedback on it. appearantly he liked what I wrote. I want to let him know if he is reading this that you inspired me to write this manifesto. THank you for everything, thank you for your friendship. 

I have been observing how the education system in Tunisa work since I starting developping a sense of self awarness. And frankly not a single moment in my (2 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 20 years) of education since kindergarden that I was happy with what I was getting. Not because the quality was not there, no, because the entire process doesn't make you smarter,but rather more abident to the imposed conformity. This conformity is a set of ideas that we were fed during these years as students that are not consistent with the current and future development of our time. This small contribution is a draft to what I aspire to become a formal manifesto, a vision for our education process in Tunisia. 

In this article I will try to divide the fondations on which the education system is built on. Comprehending the pieces is very important because it helps is understant the picture at the macro-level, and detect its anomalies. First I will start by defining the reasons why we need and education system and the socio-economic impact that such system have. Then we will dive into the different existing and missing peaces in the system.

# The macro picture

## The founding idea of education in Tunisia 

## Ideology 

## Other pieces of the puzzel

## The micro picture

## Kindergarden, the forgoten founding piece

## Primary school, too long, too underwhelming

## Elementary school, good, but misses the point

## High school, too long, too soft, with a hard finish

## University, too little,  too late
