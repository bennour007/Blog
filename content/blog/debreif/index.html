<p>When you start a new lifestyle focusing on your well being you start forgetting what the ‘before change’ feels like, but you definitely don’t forget why you started, the world will keep reminding you of that from time to time. I started thinking this to myself after a little more than two months of working from home and less than that of daily gym attendance. I cannot enumerate what good that brought me, nor I can enumerate the list of things I can do just because I don’t have to commute to the office everyday.</p>
<p>When you work from home you have the flexibility to prioritize yourself when one got some free time. In simpler terms, working remotely does not make you less of a slave to the capital owner, but it gives more freedom to manage your time, tasks, and well being in a more flexible and efficient manner. And when you successfully balance the execution of your personal and professional priorities in this bespoke fashion, comfort is the ultimate result.</p>
<p>On another note though, I’ve been applying for different opportunities here and there as a data analyst, however I don’t seem to be lucky enough to actually get an offer, other colleagues have been complaining about the same outcome as well. The last opportunity I applied for I thought I did very well in the interviews, it seems however that the competition is harder than I thought it was, the recruiters went with another candidate.</p>
<p>I am not certain why this keeps happening to me, I worked hard on my website portfolio, I always prepare well to answer and ask questions in the interviews, I keep a diplomatic tone, carefully choose my words and stay extremely respectful, yet here I am griefing my fortune instead of writing about a new era in my career.</p>
<p>What the hell is happening? Am I just delusional and all of my work is just a mere reflection of my Conscientiousness rather than the quality of my skills and knowledge? Or am I so blind I cannot see my mediocrity in front of the recruiters and I’m somehow making a fool of myself? Frankly, it all happened before, and thoug I prepared myself to accept me either screwing up the interviews(which did not happen) or simply being rejected(that… did happen), the bare facts of the rejection email always hit harder than anticipated.</p>
<p>Frankly I think the simplest solution for this hell is to find someone to teach me how its all done, a mentor would definitely help me shorten much of the road I intend to go through. For the record, this is not a new idea but it seems that I need it more than ever, a great context for the R bookclub.</p>
